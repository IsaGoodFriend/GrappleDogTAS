Before anything else, buy this game if you haven't: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1345860/Grapple_Dog/

These TAS tools use the [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) by krzys_h.  Just replace `gml_GlobalScript_input_scripts` with the code in the repos.  The game will read from "tas/inputs.txt".
